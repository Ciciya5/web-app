    Malayalam is a Dravidian language with about 38 million speakers spoken mainly in the south west of India, particularly in Kerala, the Laccadive Islands and neighboring states, and also in Bahrain, Fiji, Israel, Malaysia, Qatar, Singapore, UAE and the UK.

Malayalam was first written with the Vatteluttu alphabet , which means 'round writing' and developed from the Brahmi script. The oldest known written text in Malayalam is known as the Vazhappalli or Vazhappally inscription, is in the Vatteluttu alphabet and dates from about 830 AD.

      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHe does not come here every day.
    <br/>   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspഅവന്‍ എല്ലാദിവസവും ഇവിടെ വരാറില്ല. <br/><br/>
       &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspHis horse jumped over the fence.<br/>
          &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspഅവന്റെ കുതിര വേലിക്ക് മുകളിലൂടെ ചാടി. <br/><br/>
      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp How did you spend your vacation? <br/>
      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp    നീ എങ്ങനെ നിന്റെ അവധിക്കാലം ചെലവഴിച്ചു?  <br/> <br/>
      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspI am concerned about his health.  <br/>
      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp    എനിക്ക് അവന്റെ ആരോഗ്യത്തെപ്പറ്റി ആശങ്കയുണ്ട്.  <br/> <br/>
      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspI am not frightened of anything. <br/>
          &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspഎനിക്ക് ഒന്നിനെപ്പറ്റിയും ഭയമില്ല. <br/><br/>
        &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  I can give you a lift into town. <br/>

      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I caught the ball with one hand. <br/>
          &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspഞാൻ ഒരു കൈ കൊണ്ട് പന്ത് പിടിച്ചു. <br/><br/>
      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspI didn't know that he was there. <br/>
